# THE NON-AGGRESSION LICENSE (NAPL)

Version 1.0

## 1. PREAMBLE

This license ensures the licensed software remains a tool for peaceful cooperation and respect for individual property. It grants broad permissions for use, modification, and distribution, provided that such activities do not facilitate Aggression.

## 2. DEFINITIONS

For the purposes of this License:

- **"Aggression"** is defined as the initiation of Conflict.
- **"Conflict"** is defined as the attempt to use a Scarce Resource in contradictory ways, against the established Property Rights of an individual.
- **"Scarce Resource"** refers to any physical entity for which there is a limited supply and for which mutually exclusive uses are possible.
- **"Property Rights"** are defined as the exclusive right of a specific individual to control a Scarce Resource, acquired through original appropriation (homesteading) or voluntary exchange (contract).
- **"The Software"** refers to the source code, binaries, and documentation provided under this license.

## 3. AXIOM OF INDIVIDUALISM

This License recognizes that "Group Property" is a logical contradiction. All property rights reside solely in individuals. Any reference to collective or group ownership in external contexts is interpreted by this License as a voluntary contractual arrangement between specific individuals. No collective entity possesses rights superior to, or separate from, the individuals comprising it.

## 4. GRANT OF RIGHTS

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Author hereby grants to you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual license to:

- Use the Software for any purpose.
- Modify the Software and create derivative works.
- Distribute the Software and derivative works.

## 5. COPYLEFT

The Software is a copyleft license. You may distribute the Software or derivative works thereof, provided that you do so exclusively under the terms of this License. You must provide a copy of this License with any distribution. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.

## 6. CONDITION OF NON-AGGRESSION

The rights granted in Sections 4 and 5 are strictly conditional upon the following:
**The Software shall not be used, directly or indirectly, to commit any acts of Aggression.**

Any use of the Software to initiate Conflict—including but not limited to the unauthorized seizure of individual property, the initiation of physical violence, or the enforcement of collective claims that violate the prior appropriation of an individual—constitutes a material breach of this License.

## 7. PRIVATE POSSESSION & PRIVACY

Nothing in this License shall be construed as:

1. Forbidding the private storage of the Software on any hardware owned or controlled by you.
2. Requiring the disclosure of modified source code that is kept for private use and not distributed.
3. Asserting any claim over unrelated data or software residing on the same storage medium.
   Consistent with the NAP, your property (your hard drive and the bits contained therein) remains your exclusive domain so long as it is not used to initiate Aggression against others.

## 8. TERMINATION

If you engage in Aggression or use the Software in a manner that violates the definitions provided in Section 2, your rights under this License terminate automatically and immediately. Any further use of the Software by you thereafter constitutes copyright infringement.

## 9. NO WARRANTY

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE.

## 10. ATTRIBUTION

Redistributions of the Software must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions, and the disclaimer in Section 9.
