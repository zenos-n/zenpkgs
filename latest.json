  "content": "## Welp, it's finally officially out\n Yeah, the versions you saw until now were just betas, I didn't want to call it a 1.0 until we had mobile UI.\n Either way, it's feature-packed with stuff like\n - a tree-based option and package browsing UI\n - lazy loading and virtual options (performance stuff)\n - a mobile view\n - a scratchpad with some niceties\n - accent colors\n - clanker features\n - reduced motion\n - keyboard navigation\n - custom CSS\n - local JSON support\n - diffs against other versions of zenpkgs\n - news\n - favorites\n - search\n - recents\n - command palette\n - random package or option picker.\n\n yeah, that's a LOT.\n i hope you have as much fun using it as i had making it.\n oh and btw, surprisingly enough, even though it's clanker-made (i know, cringe, i will rewrite it in svelte without using AI later but for now it'll suffice), it's actually quite good. i guess the only issue is that it's impossible to maintain.\n like actually impossible to maintain lmfao.\n\nanyways, enough yapping, i hope you enjoy ZenOS and ZenPkgs search."
